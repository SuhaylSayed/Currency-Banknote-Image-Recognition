# Currency-Banknote-Image-Recognition
Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Decision Trees, developed a robust and precise image recognition model that accurately identifies Indian currency denominations, despite challenges posed by varying image quality, lighting conditions, and camera angles.

# Business Problem:

This project aims to develop an image recognition model capable of identifying currency note denominations based on visual features. The model should recognize all banknote denominations in different currency types in real-world situations, despite environmental factors such as image quality, lighting conditions, and camera angle. Models have been trained to identify six denominations of Indian Currency (Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50, Rs 100, Rs 200, Rs 500, and Rs 2000) using two types: Decision Trees and Convolutional Neural Networks. The approach involved training three Decision Trees with distinct feature engineering techniques and exploring two CNNs - one built from scratch and another leveraging a pre-trained model. The performance of these models and business insights are discussed in the conclusion.

# Motivation:

The project offers significant practical applications in fields such as finance, banking, and retail, where the model's ability to accurately recognize different types of currencies can make transactions faster and more reliable. Furthermore, the model will be particularly helpful for visually impaired or elderly individuals who may have trouble recognizing different types of currency. By providing a tool to make the world more accessible to the aging population, the model can directly address this challenge identified by the World Health Organization. Additionally, the model can help reduce processing costs by 80% in the financial services sector and reduce risks by accurately identifying banknotes compared to tellers.

This problem presents a unique opportunity to study and implement various machine-learning methods and models. Convolution Neural Networks and Decision Trees were explored to identify the best approach for the solution. Various data exploration and model testing techniques were employed to improve model accuracy, leading to a deeper understanding of Image Recognition, Supervised Learning methods, and machine learning as a whole.

# Dataset:

The dataset consists of 2571 images of six different currency denominations, split into six files representing each denomination. Below are sample images pulled from the dataset.
